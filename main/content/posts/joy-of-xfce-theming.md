ZZZZUsing Linux systems for almost two decades now, I have always had an interest in Linux desktop environment themeing, which in the last decade or so has become known as ricing. 

Eventually, the constant churn and randomly broken desktop components such as a panel that mysteriusoly vanished or a non-functional dock led me to stick with the stock configuration of whatever desktop environment I was using at the time.

The major desktop environenets, [KDE]() and [GNOME](), are both well polished and great out of the box. The desktop experience that they have delivered over the last few years has contributed to desktop Linux being the best it has ever been, in my opinion.

But the itch to customize and tweak my desktop environment in fun and interesting ways was still there. And then I was introduced to the concept of bootable containers.

## `bootc` As A Theming Sandbox

## What Is A Distro?

Hacker News: did we really need a whole new distro for this:
One, it's not a new distro

It's essentially a Dockerfile and a build process that says take the latest Fedora image and add all of my theming and customizations in this repeatable and reproducible way.

It didn't have to be a whole new distro, but in the age of bootc, the lines between what is a distro and what is a Dockerfile are murky at best. And writing a Dockerfile is one of 

```Dockerfile
FROM 

```

Finally, creating bootable containers with pre-loaded theming and applications brings joy to some. I can run a bootable container image on bare-metal and recognize that the operating system that is being used to draft these words is the product of my own artistic and creative expression, built on the work of countless other human beings. And that brings me joy.
