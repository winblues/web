This article presents a scattering of recent additions and changes to **Blue95 Topanga** over the past few months. Each individual change is arguably not worthy of an entire article on its own, so here they are in no particular order.

A new `ujust` recipe has been introduced to install PowerPoint templates from old products such as Office 97 that have been collected and hosted in the Internet Archive's [Microsoft Powerpoint Templates Pack](https://archive.org/details/powerpoint-templates).

```bash
ujust install-ppt-templates
```

The templates will be placed in `~/Documents/Presentations/Templates`.
