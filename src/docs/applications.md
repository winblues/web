Blue95 provides the Chicago95 icon set for LibreOffice Writer, but it must be installed manually.

First copy the `.oxt` file to a location accessible from within the Flatpak environment:

```bash
cp /usr/share/libreoffice/extensions/Chicago95-theme-0.0.oxt ~
```

Launch LibreOffice Writer and open the Extensions menu by going to Tools > Extensions. Click "Add" and select the file `Chicago95-theme-0.0.oxt` in your home directory. Then, restart LibreOffice when prompted.

Once installed, open the Tools > Options menu, navigate to LibreOffice > View, and under Icon Theme, select Chicago95.
