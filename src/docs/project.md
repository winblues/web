## Core System

Blue95 is based on the solid foundation of <img src="../img/emblems/fedora.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;">  [Fedora Xfce](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/xfce).
We pull in tweaks from <img src="../img/emblems/ublue-os.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> [Universal Blue](https://github.com/ublue-os) (e.g. codecs, automatic updates, etc) to produce a more usable out-of-the box experience.

Following the lead of Universal Blue, Blue95 embraces <img src="../img/emblems/flathub.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> [Flathub](https://flathub.org) as the universal Linux App Store for GUI applications.
For command-line applications, <img src="../img/emblems/homebrew.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed by default. Updates for Flatpaks and Homebrew applications are automatically enabled.

## Aesthetic

Blue95 aims to provide an aesthetic rooted in a bygone era of computing that is intended to remind its users of design elements from the 1990s. Most of the heavy lifting is taken care of by <img src="../img/emblems/chicago95.png" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"> [Chicago95](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95) and any changes to the visual elements of Blue95 should be upstreamed to that project where applicable.


However, Blue95 is not aiming to be a faithful reproduction of any particular decades-old operating system. Pixel perfect recreation of GUI elements is not within the scope of this project.

Whenever usability and exact replication are at odds, usability and accessibility will generally be preferred.
